### Technical Round assignment for Front End development Internship selection at Envoka Business Pvt. Ltd.

Task:
1. Use newsapi.org API and display data in a tabular format 
2. Implement Pagination in table 
3. Implement Media Queries on the UI

### Solution: https://excalibur1702.github.io/news-search/

Note: This app requires a newsapi.org API Key. My key (which is loaded in by default) is from the Developer plan, which doesn't allow requests from browsers. Hence, this app will only work on a localhost with my API Key, but would work online with a key from a paid plan.
